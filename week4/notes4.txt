ELEMENT PROPERTIES
element.XXX

Content
.innerHTML: "<p>Hello!</p> -> will be interpreted by browser as HTML code, as opposed to plain text
.innerText: "Hello!" -> will be interpreted by browser as plain text


Form element-specific properties
.value: for things like <input>, <textarea>, <select>
.checked: for checkboxes and radios
.placeholder: placeholder text for an input element

Style/Layour elements
.style.backgroundColor: Edits inline CSS elements
.className: gets/sets the class name of element


Attributes/Identification purposes
.id: unique ID of element






OTHER COMMANDS
console.log("string"): prints into the console (chrome dev tools)
console.log(document.getElementById("id")): will let you see what HTML input you're working with in the console

When adding event listeners
document.getElementById("justin-btn").addEventListener('mouseover', mouse_over);
don't add parenthesis () behind the function you're calling, or it will be called immediately
WRONG CODE: document.getElementById("justin-btn").addEventListener('mouseover', mouse_over());

document.querySelectorAll(#id) returns a NodeList containing elements that match the selector (#id). 
if elements are contained within a div, selecting the div's #id will select all elements within the div

array.forEach(function): loops through each element in the array and calls the function
array.forEach(btn => function): basically the javascript equivalent of 
py
    for btn in array:
        function
.py
