BASIC API GET REQUEST (asynchronous)
let api_endpoint_url = 'http://krazywoman.com/krazystars/api/star/read.php'

    axios.get(api_endpoint_url) //making a GET request and sending it to the url
    .then(response => {
        //Inspect the response in JS Console
        console.log(response);
    }) 
    .catch((error) => {
        console.log(error.message);
    })


SYNCHRONOUS: waiting till an action is completed before continuing 
ASYNCHRONOUS: move on to next line while function is in progress -> Allows webpages to render first before all APIs are fully called


`` - Template literals (study on this) current understanding is that they behave like python's F-strings -> using ${} to format variables

DON'T USE INNERHTML. use createElement and createTextNode or you'll get penalised


<body onload = "get_all()"> : Allows you to instantly call a function on loading a webpage
